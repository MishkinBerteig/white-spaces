      Whenever you need to lay out pictures, text notes, video and audio clips on a blank canvas,
      White-Spaces can help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      White-Spaces is a browser based application. It is the right tool for you if you want to quickly put together a collage of your idea or concept, either for yourself or to share it with teammembers, clients or students. Changes are updated in realtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      White-Spaces is not meant for creating polished designs, but it is a good fit for:

    <ul>
      <li>Moodboards</li>
      <li>Collages</li>
      <li>Teaching (Virtual Blackboards)</li>
      <li>Shared Whiteboards</li>
      <li>Design Thinking</li>
    </ul>
